    heading: "What is Carbon Footprints?",
    answer:
      "A carbon footprint is the total amount of  greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon compounds, that are emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, event, or product throughout its lifecycle. Greenhouse gases contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere and leading to global warming and climate change.",
    answer1:
      "Carbon footprints are typically measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) to account for the varying global warming potential of different greenhouse gases. The major sources of carbon footprints include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and deforestation.",
    answer2:
      "Reducing carbon footprints is a key goal in the effort to mitigate climate change. Individuals and organizations can take steps to minimize their carbon footprints by adopting energy-efficient practices, using renewable energy sources, improving transportation efficiency, and making sustainable choices in consumption. Additionally, initiatives such as carbon offset programs allow individuals and businesses to invest in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas emissions to offset their own emissions.",

    heading: "What is Streaks?",
    answer:
      "The streaks value increases as the user consistently updates the types of food they consume each day. By logging this information, the system can track and calculate the carbon footprint associated with their dietary choices. This encourages users to maintain a streak of environmentally conscious eating habits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon emissions related to their food consumption",

    answer: "What Diets Drive Carbon Emissions And By How Much?",
    answer1:
      "It is well understood that meat production has a big carbon footprint.Numerous studies detail the climate impact of livestock, but just how big is it’s impact on a person’s foodprint? By impact we mean the amount of carbon dioxide for a given diet after adding up all the contributions from raising the food source and transporting it.",
    answer2:
      "This figure, over the course of a year, becomes more than a ton per individual.This post compares the carbon footprints of five different American diets and finds that when it comes to foodprints vegans come out on top.If you’re interested in a numerical breakdown of carbon footprint for different kinds of food, take a look at our new carbon footprint food database.",

    heading: "Meat Intensity Drives Big Variation In Carbon Emission",
    answer:
      "Even since the FAO announced that 18% of global emission result from livestock people have talked about the climate benefits of reducing meat consumption.More recent studies show that food system emissions could account for as much as quarter of all human emissions.  ",
    answer1:
      "That is 12% from agricultural production, another 9% from farming induced deforestation, and a further 3% from things like refrigeration and freight.Such studies beg the heading, what is the impact of meat on an individual’s foodprint?",

    answer:
      "The results of our analysis look like the below. A diet heavy in meat will have about twice the carbon foodprint as a vegetarian or vegan diet. Some people call a meat lover diet the “carnivore diet”.",
    answer1:
      "If you’re interested in the numbers behind the meat analysis, you can check out our article on the carbon footprint of different meats.In that article you will see that the carbon footprint of red meat like beef is ten times higher than poultry like chicken.",

    answer:
      "An Average American’s diet has a foodprint of around 2.5 t CO2e per person each year. For a Meat Lover this rises to 3.3 t CO2e,  for the No Beef diet it is 1.9 t  t CO2e,",
    answer1:

      "3. No Beef Diet – Meat Gives 1/4 Of Food Energy Yet Half Of Carbon Emissions",
    answer:
      "In the No Beef diet all the reductions from the Average foodprint come by switching from beef to chicken.Interestingly, we find that the average diet animal products make up 60% of emissions despite accounting for just a quarter of food energy. ",
    answer1:
      "The Meat Lover beef consumption causes almost half of emissions from just a tenth of food energy.The difference between the Vegetarian and Vegan diets arises from dairy consumption being switched to a mix of cereals and vegetables.",

      "All Diets Share A Constant 60%, The Remainder Contributes To The Different Foodprints",
    answer:
      "Perhaps the most fascinating thing is that although the foodprints vary greatly, three fifths of each diet is identical.In other words, 60% of food energy consumed is the same in each of these four diets.",
    answer1:
      "The share that is constant accounts for 1550 kcal of food energy per day and about 0.7 t CO2e of each foodprint.So all the variation depends on the remaining 1,000 kcal per day. ",
    answer2:
      "The Vegan gets these 1000 kcal for 0.8 t CO2e, the Vegetarian for 1 t,  No Beef for 1.2 t, Average for 1.8 t and the Meat Lover for 2.6 t.",

    answer:
      "Each of these five diets are variations of the average American diet based on data from the USDA’s Economic Research Service.For each of our diets we assume consumption of around  2,600 kcal of food energy each day, roughly equal to an average American.",
    answer1:
      "This should not be confused with total food supply which is around 3,900 kcal each day.  In each diet food energy is split up among nine different food groups.The five diets are all variations on the average diet.",
    answer2:
      "We assume the Meat Lover eats more red meat, white meat and dairy in place of some cereals, fruit and vegetables. The No Beef diet is just the average diet with all beef consumption switched to chicken. ",
    answer3:
      "The Vegetarian switches away from beef and chicken to fruit and vegetables, while also reducing oils and snacks.The Vegan does much the same as the vegetarian while also eliminating dairy through further switching to cereals, fruits and vegetables.",

      "The Inherent Emissions Of Each Food Group Contributes To The Big Differences",
    answer:
      "The reason that these five foodprints vary so much despite being so similar is that the carbon intensity of food consumption differs greatly between the food groups.To estimate each foodprints we first calculated the carbon intensity of food consumption in each group.",
    answer1:
      "This involved estimating the cradle to retail emissions of food production (kg CO2e/kg product), converting each to emissions per unit food energy produced, and then adjusting for food waste and supply chain losses. ",
    answer2:
      "This gives emissions per unit of food consumed (g CO2e/kcal).  For a more complete explanation see our shrink your food footprint page.",

    heading: "Order Of Carbon Intensiveness: Red Meat, Dairy, Fruit, Chicken",
    answer:
      "Unsurprisingly red meat is the most carbon intensive way to get food energy, followed by dairy, fruit and chicken. ",
    answer1:
      "Cereals, oils and snacks are the least carbon intensive.  These factors are the reason why foodprints gets smaller as less red meat, dairy and chicken are consumed.",
    answer2:
      "Although the carbon intensity of food production is the main driver in these figures, each is also influenced by how calorific foods are and what scale of supply chain losses and consumer waste they suffer.",

  {
    heading: "Oils, Snacks, Cereals Have High Calories And Low Waste",

      "Why A Vegetarian Leaves A Smaller Ecological Footprint Than An Omnivore",
    answer:
      "We’re often asked why a vegan or vegetarian has a smaller eco footprint than an omnivore.The answer is found in the analysis above.",
    answer1:
      "The carbon intensity of meat is higher than that of non-meat. The carbon intensity is higher because much food and energy goes into raising an animal.It’s more efficient for you to get that energy directly, for example protein from nuts, than to get it indirectly from beef.",
    answer2:
      "When the animal is very large, like a cow, the equivalent carbon cost is enormous. Using food groups also hides great variation of carbon intensity within each group.  ",
    answer3:
      "A hot housed tomato can have emissions 5 times higher than one grown in season, potatoes have tiny footprints compared to many other vegetables, and cheese has much higher emission than milk. So by limiting ourselves to just nine food groups we greatly understate the potential that changing diet has to reduce food emissions.",
