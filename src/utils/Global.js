    question: "What is Carbon Footprints?",
    answer:
      "A carbon footprint is the total amount of  greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon compounds, that are emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, event, or product throughout its lifecycle. Greenhouse gases contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere and leading to global warming and climate change.",
    answer1:
      "Carbon footprints are typically measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) to account for the varying global warming potential of different greenhouse gases. The major sources of carbon footprints include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and deforestation.",
    answer2:
      "Reducing carbon footprints is a key goal in the effort to mitigate climate change. Individuals and organizations can take steps to minimize their carbon footprints by adopting energy-efficient practices, using renewable energy sources, improving transportation efficiency, and making sustainable choices in consumption. Additionally, initiatives such as carbon offset programs allow individuals and businesses to invest in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas emissions to offset their own emissions.",

    question:"What is Streaks?",
    answer:"The streaks value increases as the user consistently updates the types of food they consume each day. By logging this information, the system can track and calculate the carbon footprint associated with their dietary choices. This encourages users to maintain a streak of environmentally conscious eating habits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon emissions related to their food consumption",
